# Hello! 👋

### My name is Dave Koo, a Web Development graduate with a background in Business & Sales. 

I'm currently looking for my next opportunity as a Front-End developer to hone my development skills but more importantly learn as much as I can from others! 

Previously, I've interned at <B>SAP</B> as a Front-End Developer on the Green Team!
