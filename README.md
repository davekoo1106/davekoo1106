# Hello! 👋

My name is Dave Koo, a Web Development graduate with a background in Business & Sales. 

I'm currently looking for my next opportunity as a Front-End developer to hone my development skills but more importantly learn as much as I can from others! 

Previously, I've interned at <B>SAP</B> as a Front-End Developer on the Green Team! 

My work can be found here: davekoo.com (ps. Currently undergoing a complete redesign and development so some things may not work properly! Please be patient! :) )

✉️ Get in touch with me!
